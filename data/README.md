# Data Directory

This subdirectory is what normally holds the data files used by the tests
and examples.

To download the "default version" of the files (corresponding to the version
of the code in the repository), just execute

```
./traccc_data_get_files.sh
```

without any additional arguments.

To produce a new tarball of data files, use the `traccc_data_package_files.sh`
script.
